The Eclipse Leda project provides system image "recipes" to deliver a functional and always-available Linux-based image/distribution in the context of SDV (Software Defined Vehicle), by pulling together individual contributor pieces from [Eclipse SDV](https://sdv.eclipse.org/) and the larger OSS community.

The quickstart images help to learn how the SDV development, test and deployment lifecycle works from an E2E perspective, including the deployment of applications into the container runtimes on constrained embedded devices.

The ready images are also useful for quickly setting up showcases with virtual or real hardware devices.

Eclipse Leda provides a Poky-based reference build pipeline and an OpenEmbedded Metalayer [meta-leda](https://github.com/eclipse-leda/meta-leda) for integration into existing Yocto-based projects.
