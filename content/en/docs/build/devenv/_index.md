There are multiple variants on how to set up a build environment:

- with [GitHub Codespaces](/leda/docs/build/devenv/github-codespaces/) - recommended for developers with restricted internet access, such as corporate proxies, or with Windows hosts
- with [VSCode DevContainer](/leda/docs/build/devenv/vscode-devcontainer/) - recommended for Linux hosts
- Custom setup - for teams
