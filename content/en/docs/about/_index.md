The Eclipse Leda project will provide system image “recipes” to deliver a functional Linux-based image/distribution in the context of SDV (Software Defined Vehicle), by pulling together individual contributons from the SDV and the larger OSS community.

The Eclipse Leda distribution will work with build scripts, package definitions, image build pipelines, etc, with the goal to pull SDV projects and dependecies from the larger OSS community into a working Linux system. Such system images (or other useful forms of delivery, as determined by the project) will be made available for consumption for anyone who is interested in working with the SDV tech stack. These deliveries take the form of container (base) images, installable/flashable image files, etc (again to be evolved by the project team according to community needs). Also in scope is concise and useful documentation for consumers of the project's deliverables, plus a method of delivering that documentation.

In the context described above - the ambition of SDV to build a technology ecosystem for software-defined vehicle concern - a prime challenge will be the combination of these initially diverse components into a coherent and useful whole: all the software components in the world will not have the impact needed to transform the automotive industry unless we can make them play together coherently an form a functional portfolio. As a first step towards that goal, this proposal (Eclipse Leda) is for a "SDV distribution" project that pulls together individual contributor pieces from SDV and the larger OSS community, to deliver a functional and always-available Linux-based image/distribution with two primary goals:

- be the crystalization point for functionally integrating diverse SDV-scope projects into a working whole

- deliver a continually available, always working starting image for developers interested in getting going with the SDV tech stack
